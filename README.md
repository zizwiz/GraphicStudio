A few graphics utilities in one app
 
Over the years I have created a few graphics apps to do various tasks. I usually find an algorthim written by some very clever person and I use that to build an app. As these were just for my own use they do not contain all the bells and whistles of a commercial product but they do exactly what I need and as I have the code I can change them as I need. I have recently started to put the utilities into one app so I can always find it and this is what you can see here.
 
I do not claim this as all my own work and for some of the algorithims I have used I do not know who wrote them so cannot credit the author. If you think some of this could be your work let me know and I will add your name to the credits. I believe in open source and helping others.
